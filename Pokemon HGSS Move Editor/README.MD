Program for editing move data in the generation 4 pokemon game roms (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum/Heartgold/Soulsilver).


THIS ONLY RUNS IN WINDOWS (Tested on windows 8.1 & 10)

Features:
* View data for all 467 moves in gen 4 pokemon game roms, including contest data and flags for contact, protect, king's rock, etc.
* Edit all of this move data
* Save changes to binary file that can be spliced into the roms with other tools
* Create data for new moves (animation data and in-game name still must be setup with other tools)
* Support for types added through romhacking beyond the originals


I highly recommend using the tool crystal tile to to insert the output binary file into a rom.


Planned future features:
* ability to save changes in xDelta3 patch file
* ability to save changes directly to rom file or copy
* set animation data for new moves?
* set name in roms for new moves?
